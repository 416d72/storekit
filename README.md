# StoreKit

A next generation E-Commerce theme built with SvelteKit.

# What did I learn through this project?
- SvelteKit
  > This is how to build a modern website

  > Absolutely love it!
- Typescript
  > What a discovery!
- GraphQL
  > Only the basics of client side
- WooCommerce REST API
  > I already had experience with building with Wordperss+Woocommerce

  > But this was a good refresher on the API
- TailwindCSS v3.0
  > I used v2 in previous projects
  
  > I barely write plain CSS at this point
